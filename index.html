        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Wessel and since 2012 I’ve been repairing typewriters. I’ve been an avid writer since I was a teenager, but at some point I kept getting distracted by the internet when trying to write on my computer. At the same time, I hated how slow writing by hand was and so I started researching typewriters.
A few weeks after that I picked up my first machine. When I got home I noticed that the bell was not quite ringing properly. I took apart the machine, fixed the bell, put it back together and went back online to see if people needed someone to fix their broken typewriters.</p>

        <h2>Restoration</h2>
        <p>I specialize (and I know that’s a pretty funny thing to say when we’re talking about something that’s already VERY specialized) in portable typewriters from the 1920’s to 1970’s. 
Fifty percent of my tools are vintage typewriter repair tools that I got from a retired typewriter repairman. Most of them aren’t made anymore today so I’m very careful with them. The other fifty percent consists of an ungodly amount of screwdrivers and even a 3D printer which I mostly use to print new rubber feet and rollers which can deform after nearly a century.
